* Who am I?
Art Eidukas,
- degree: BSc Economics
- email: [[mailto:arturas.eidukas@ons.gov.uk][arturas.eidukas@ons.gov.uk]]:
- website: [[https://finnkauski.com][https://finnkauski.com]]
- github: [[https://github.com/finnkauski][@finnkauski]]

* Career Path
- Economist (Sandwich Student)
- Economic Researcher
  - Data Science Accelerator
- Data Scientist (HEO)
- Data Scientist (SEO)
- Software Developer / DevOps (G7)

* Pre-accelerator
- General interest in computers
- Age 13 attended computer training courses

** Constantly playing with tech
- Used to build game servers at age 14+ with friends
- Build websites for the fun of it
- Stopped after school

** In ONS (Prices)
- Sandwich students workload
- Learned python just to avoid SAS
- Applied python to my hobbies at home
- Showed value and they kept giving me more work
- Decided that being an economist was not for me

* Accelerator
- No ML knowledge before this (shaky knowledge of stats)
- Prices focused project
- Match online and offline item descriptions

* Example
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
aisle6 cereal red packging Spc. K

vs.

'Special K', berry flavour cereal, 250g
#+END_QUOTE

* Outcome
- Was not that useful in the end
- Helped me land my first Data Scientist job in government

** Takeaways [1/2]
- Didn't know enough about Natural Language Processing to solve the problem
- Demystified the voodoo behind the term Data Science
- No need to code Neural Networks from scratch

** Takeaways [2/2]
- You need to debug and read a lot
- Multiple ways to achieve similar things
- I needed a better grasp of algorithm strengths and weaknesses

** Algorithms be like:

* Lesson 1

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Don't fear to fail!
#+END_QUOTE
Two outcomes from this programme:
- Some value from sucessful prototype for the respective departments
- Your development

* Challenges / Tips

** 1. Data - Be a Data Sceptic

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
DO NOT assume you have the data.

MAKE SURE you have it.
#+END_QUOTE

Even before the first mentoring day, chase and pester people who promised you
the data for the project if you don't have it already.

** Side note - Data Security

- Chase people on what kind of precautions you need to take when handling the
  data.

- Ask who can see it, where it can be stored and how it can be transported.

Better safe than sorry!

** 2. Coding experience

- When I started the accelerator I thought I was good enough
- I learned a lot in a very short period of time
- Learned tons of new libraries

** No silver bullet

- If you haven't coded before it will be harder 
- Learning to code something is an 'easy' win
- Often times it will be more valuable than the Data Science side

** Tips:

- Learn by doing - read, extract key knowledge and apply (GeoHotz)
- Mentors - but don't expect them to write code for you

** 3. Tedium of Data Massaging

- Flipping data and shoehorning it into the right shape is tedious
- 80% of data science
- The more you prepare upfront, the more of the 20% you will end up doing

** However...

- Learning to wrangle data is key
- The better you know the how, the faster you'll do it next time


* The Number 12

Why do you think I'm bringing it up?

** You will be working against the clock
    This programme boils down to 12 working days

** Here's why:

** Tips [1/2]:
- Plan (roughly)
- Eyes one the prize. Don't go down rabbitholes
- Working pipeline (MVP)

** Tips [2/2]
- Take notes on where you can improve things
- You will have to be aware and adult about your trade-offs
- Ambition is good but mind the trade-off

* Lesson 2:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If you have a proof of concept that *adds value*, you can always build on it.

Bells and whistles can wait.

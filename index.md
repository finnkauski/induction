# Lets set the scene&#x2026;

## Who am I?

Art Eidukas,

- degree: BSc Economics
- role: Software Developer / Devops
- email: [arturas.eidukas@ons.gov.uk](mailto:arturas.eidukas@ons.gov.uk):
- website: [https://finnkauski.com](https://finnkauski.com)
- github: [@finnkauski](https://github.com/finnkauski)

## Career Path

2015 September

- Economist (Sandwich Student)
- Economic Researcher (HEO)
  - Data Science Accelerator
- Data Scientist (HEO)
- Data Scientist (SEO)
- Software Developer / DevOps (G7)

Now

## Pre-accelerator

- General interest in computers
- Age 13 attended computer training courses

### Constantly playing with tech

- Used to build game servers at age 14+ with friends
- Build websites for the fun of it
- Came to a halt after finishing school

### In ONS (Prices)

- Sandwich students workload limbo
- Learned python just to avoid SAS
- Applied python to my hobbies at home
- Showed value and they kept giving me more work
- Decided that being an economist was not for me

# Accelerator

- No ML knowledge before this (shaky knowledge of stats)
- Prices focused project
- Match online and offline item descriptions

# Example

> aisle6 cereal red packging Spc. K
>
> vs.
>
> &rsquo;Special K&rsquo;, berry flavour cereal, 250g

# Outcome

- Was not that useful in the end (some projects spin-off)
- Helped me land my first Data Scientist job in government (book)
- Allowed me to stop being an Economist and pursue code

## We&rsquo;re all different

## A bit more detail

## Takeaways <code>[1/2]</code>

- Didn&rsquo;t know enough about Natural Language Processing to solve the problem
- Demystified the voodoo behind the term Machine Learning
- No need to code Neural Networks from scratch
- Big push now is to democratise DS making it easier for anyone to do

## Takeaways <code>[2/2]</code>

- You need to debug and read a lot
- Multiple ways to achieve similar things
- I needed a better grasp of algorithm strengths and weaknesses

## Algorithms be like:

# Lesson 1

> Don&rsquo;t fear to fail!

Two outcomes from this programme:

- Some value from sucessful prototype for the respective departments
- Your development
- Optimising contact time

# Challenges / Tips

## 1. Data - Be a Data Sceptic

> DO NOT assume you have the data.
>
> MAKE SURE you have it.

Even before the first mentoring day, chase and pester people who promised you
the data for the project if you don&rsquo;t have it already.

## Side note - Data Security

- Chase people on what kind of precautions you need to take when handling the
  data.

- Ask who can see it, where it can be stored and how it can be transported.

Better safe than sorry!

## 2. Coding experience

- When I started the accelerator I thought I was good enough
- I learned a lot in a very short period of time
- Learned tons of new libraries

## No silver bullet

- If you haven&rsquo;t coded before it will be harder (but you learn patterns)
- Learning to code something is an &rsquo;easy&rsquo; win
- Often times it will be more valuable than the Data Science side

## Tips:

- Learn by doing - read, extract key knowledge and apply (GeoHotz)
- Mentors - but don&rsquo;t expect them to write code for you

## 3. Tedium of Data Massaging

- Flipping data and shoehorning it into the right shape is tedious
- 80% of data science
- The more you prepare upfront, the more of the 20% you will end up doing

## However&#x2026;

- Learning to wrangle data is key
- The better you know the how, the faster you&rsquo;ll do it next time

# The Number 12

Why do you think I&rsquo;m bringing it up?

## You will be working against the clock

This programme boils down to 12 working days

## Here&rsquo;s why:

## Tips <code>[1/2]</code>:

- Plan (roughly)
- Eyes one the prize. Don&rsquo;t go down rabbitholes (be self-aware)
- Working pipeline (MVP)

## Tips <code>[2/2]</code>

- Take notes on where you can improve things
- Be aware of skills, time, learning, delivery trade-offs
- Ambition is good, but within reason

# Lesson 2:

> If you have a proof of concept that **adds value**, you can always build on it.
>
> Bells and whistles can wait.
